A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, has approached you to help them develop a 
new landing page for their company. They've handed you a [mockup](./relaxr_landing.jpg) for the site, along with the [copy](./design_file.md) and [assets](./images). 

## Setup

Files have been provided for you! Work in your `index.html` and `style.css`.

Image resources are available to you.

## Completion

Using just HTML and CSS, make your website look just like the mockup! I would also like you to make this a node app before you upload it to github and hand the assignment in (HINT: If you need a step-by-step on how to set this up, [click here!](https://github.com/BrianCarela/node-mustache-express-templating))

## Assignment

You need to take these files and turn it into a landing page that approximates 
the following mockup:
